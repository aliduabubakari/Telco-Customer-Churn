# Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Strategies

üîé Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service within a specific timeframe.

## üìä Project Objective: 

Identify the likelihood of customer churn, key indicators of churn, and effective retention strategies.

## üéØ Importance: 

Customer attrition is a significant expenditure for organizations, and understanding churn can help develop effective retention initiatives.

### üìà Example: 

If you started the year with 500 customers and ended with 480, the churn rate would be 4%.

# üîç Project Scope:

1. Analyze customer data to determine the likelihood of churn.

2. Identify key indicators or factors that contribute to customer attrition.

3. Develop retention strategies to prevent customer churn.

4. Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented strategies.

# üí° Benefits:

1. Improve customer retention rates and reduce churn.

2. Optimize resource allocation by targeting high-risk customers.

3. Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# üìö Methodology:

## Data collection: 

Gather customer information, including usage patterns, demographics, and feedback.

### Data Understanding

## Exploratory data analysis: 

Analyze data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential churn indicators.

### Univariate Analysis 

![Alt text](image/Univariate.jpg)

73.46 % of customers did not churn, and 26.54% of customers did churn which indicates imbalanced data. 

### Bivariate Analysis

### Multivariate Analysis

### Hypothesis testing 

The likelihood of a customer leaving the organization is influenced by their contract type

NULL: Customers on 2-year contracts are less likely to churn 

Alternate: Customers on 2-year contracts are more likely to churn

![Alt text](image/Hypothesis.png)

Since the obtained p-value is significantly smaller than the conventional significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can conclude that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that customers on 2-year contracts are more likely to churn, supporting the alternative hypothesis.

### Business question

Is there a relationship between monthly charges and customer churn?

![Alt text](image/BusinessQ.png)

Based on the boxplot, it appears that customers who churn tend to have higher monthly charges compared to those who do not churn


## Churn prediction modeling: 

Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast customer churn.

## Feature importance analysis: 

Determine the key factors that influence churn using Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation.

## Retention strategy development: 

Based on the findings, create strategies to engage and retain customers.

![Alt text](image/retention.jpg)

Offer loyalty rewards: Since the highest percentage of churned customers belong to the demographic of females with no partners or dependents and males with no partners or dependents, it may be worth offering these customers loyalty rewards such as discounts, freebies or personalized offers to incentivize them to stay.


# üöÄ Expected Results:

- Accurate identification of customers at risk of churn.

- Insights into the factors driving customer attrition.

-Tailored retention strategies to mitigate churn and improve customer loyalty.
